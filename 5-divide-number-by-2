// 5.	Write a program to demonstrate an O(log N) time complexity operation (e.g., repeatedly dividing a number by 2 until it reaches 1). Explain why it's O(log N) in comments.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;

    // Ask the user to enter a number
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    // Keep dividing the number by 2 until it becomes 1
    while (n > 1) {
        printf("%d\n", n);  // Print the current number
        n = n / 2;          // Divide the number by 2
    }

    // Print the final value 1
    printf("%d\n", n);

    return 0;
